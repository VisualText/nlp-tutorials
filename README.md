## Tutorial 08 (Part 1): Resolving Pronouns by Building KBs on the Fly

Part one is an overview. NLP++ allows for the building of knowledge bases from text on the fly that can be used to parse the text itself. The analyzer in this tutorial shows how NLP++ can resolve pronouns or what is known in linguistics as anaphora: [YouTube Video Tutorial 8-1](https://youtu.be/YHsrd9TDKlE)
